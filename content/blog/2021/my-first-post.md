I like lists because they are :

- fun
+ easy, and
+ fast.

Lists can also be ordered:

1. First element
2. Second element
    - with an unordered sublist

And you can add tables:
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| I        | like     |  tables  |
| This     |  Is      |  content |
